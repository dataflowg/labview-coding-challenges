# LabVIEW Reddit Challange 1 - Clock
## Challenge
https://www.reddit.com/r/LabVIEW/comments/lfm9mf/labview_reddit_challenge_february_2021/

> GOAL: Create a clock that continuously shows the current time in real life.
>
> Points:
> 
> [1] Block diagram: Less is more. The less amount of block-diagram objects you use, the better you will score.
> 
> [2] Block diagram: Simple is better. The more basic tools you use, the better you will score. (I need to understand what I'm going to judge, haha)
>
> [3] Front panel: Give it a modern look. Interpret that however you like.
> 
> Note: Giving something a modern look might make you use more block diagram elements - that is fine as long as you can find a good balance between "cost" ([1],[2]) and "gain" ([3]).
>
> Deadline: 21 February
