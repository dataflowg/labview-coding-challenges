# LabVIEW Reddit Coding Challenge - June 2021
A steganography routine which encodes a hidden message into an image. Source code saved with LabVIEW 2020.

The encoding routine uses bitmap images, and can encode anywhere from 464,133 bytes with a score of 0.00061616, up to 79,366,743 bytes (or 171 copies of the message) with a score of 0.0345245.

Further optimizations are possible and are documented in `Encode Compressed Message.vi`, but haven't been implemented.
